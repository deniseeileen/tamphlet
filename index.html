            <h1>About the guide and why it's different</h1>

            <p>Tamphlet is a simple guide that teaches girls how to use tampons for the first time. It displays the most needed
            information quickly and clearly so that each girl can have a more comfortable and confident experience.</p>

            <p>Unlike traditional tampon instructions, tamphlet features readable text and modern illustrations. It is primarily a
            visual learning guide, designed with the understanding that this is a completely new experience and aims to
            make young girls as familiar with their bodies as possible.</p>

            <p>Tamphlet was inspired by the common first period experiences of grown women with the hope that by sharing
            what we wished we had known then, future girls will be able to experience their first periods without embarrassment
            or discomfort.</p>
